Array tasks: (You must use for array to solve all these problem)
1. Take an input N. In the next line input N integers. Print this N integers in separate lines.
2. Input N integers. Determine the average. Print the average with two digit after the decimal point.
3. Write a program to copy an array into another array and print both array. (the size of the array should be taken from keyboard).
4. Given a list of numbers. Save the numbers in an Array. Finally, reverse the array elements and output in a line separated by space.
5. Write a program in C to merge two arrays.
6. Write a program in C to separate odd and even integers in separate arrays. Print the array with odd and even sum.
7. Write a program to find whether a number is there in an array or not.
8. Write a program in C to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
9. Given an array. Insert a new value in a specific index and reorder the array again.
10. Given an array. Remove a specific index element and reorder the array again.
11. Write a program that calculates the summation of all rich numbers of an array. A rich number is a number that is greater than all the previous
 elements.
12. Write a program in C to find the second largest element in an array.
13. Write a program to find the frequency of number X from the given array.

in this problem you have to Reverse the given Array
So if the given array is 1 2 3 4 5
after reversing it will be 5 4 3 2 1

we take 2 line as input

Explanation for Problem 6: Write a program in C to separate odd and even integers in separate arrays. 
Print the array with odd and even sum.


In this Problem there will be a given array size  and  element of the array
you have to take an element from the array and put it into a different array in the basis of their evenness

So if the input is,
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Then the output will be like this.
Even Array: 2 4 6 8 10
Even Sum: 30
Odd Array: 1 3 5 7 9
Odd Sum: 25

Test Case For Problem_6:

Output_3: 
-2 -4 - 6 -8 -10
-30
-1 -3 -5 -7 -9
-25


Explanation for Problem 7: 
Write a program to find whether a number is there in an array or not.

In this probelm you have to search for a number in the array
so if input is like this
10
5 8 3 18 7 10 15 14 13 2
2
That means you have to search for 2 from the array and have to print is it in the array or not
though 2 is in the  array so we will print 
Yes the number is in the array.

Test Case For Problem_7:

Input_1:
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10

Output_1: 
the number is in the array.

Input_2:
5
1 2 3 4 5
6

Output_2: 
The number is not in the array

Input_3:
10
1 -1 2 -2 3 4 -5 6 7 -8
7

Output_3: 
The number is in the array.


Explanation for Problem 8: Write a program in C to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
In this problem you have to find the minimum and maximum value from a given array

So if there is a given array like this
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

we can see that the maximum value is 10 and the minimum is 1
So the output will be

Minimum: 1
Maximum: 10

Test Case For Problem_8:

Input_1:
10
10 20 30 40 50 60 88 99 11 9

1


Explanation for Problem 9:Given an array. Insert a new value in a specific index and reorder the array again.


in this problem you will given a array and a index number and a new number for insert
so input will be like this
4
1 2 3 5
3 4
so here 3rd line of input indicate fisrt number is the index number and second number is the element you have to insert
so after insert the value output array will be 

1 2 3 4 5

Test Case For Problem_9:

Input_1:

Input_3:
4
1 1 1 1
2 2

Output_3: 
1 1 2 1 1


Explanation for Problem 10:
In this problem you have to take an array as input and an index_number  which one you have to delete
6 > Size of the array
1 2 3 4 5 6  > elements of array
4 > the index you have to delete

Output:
1 2 3 4 6

6
1 2 1 2 1 2
5

Output_3: 
1 2 1 2 1


Explanation for Problem 11:
In this problem you have to find the summation of all rich number
A rich number means it is greater than all of his previous element of the array
so is we consider a sample input like this
Input:
10
1 2 5 4 7 6 8 9 11 3
here 1 is a rich number so sum=1
2 is also a rich because it is greater than 1 so sum=1+2
5 is also rich because it is greater than 1 and 2 so sum=1+2+5
but 4 is not a rich number so sum=1+2+5
7 is also a rich because it is greater than 1,2,5,4 so sum=1+2+5+7
but 6 is not a rich number so sum=1+2+5+7
8 is also a rich because it is greater than 1,2,5,4,7,6 so sum=1+2+5+7+8
9 is also a rich because it is greater than 1,2,5,4,7,6,8 so sum=1+2+5+7+8+9
11 is also a rich because it is greater than 1,2,5,4,7,6,8,9 so sum=1+2+5+7+8+9+11
but 3 is not a rich number
so final sum = 1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 11 = 43
Output:
43

Test Case For Problem_11:

Input_1:
10
1 2 5 4 7 6 8 9 11 3

Output_1:
43

Input_2:
20
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

210

Input_3:
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output_3: 
10


Explanation for Problem 12:
in this  problem you have to find the 2nd large number from an array 
You will take input 2 lines of number first line to contain the size of the array and second-line contains the element of the array

So if we consider below sample as input
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Then the 2nd large number is 9
so we will print 9 as our answer

Test Case For Problem_12:

Input_1:
10
1 5 8 2  25 5 92 6 225 595 48

Output_1: 
225

Input_2:
15
89 25 25 84 621 485 221 452 25 21 45 81 626 52 522

Output_2: 
621

Input_3:
10
-1 -2 0 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9

Output_3: 
-1


Explanation for Problem 13:
In this problem we need to find the sequence of a number from a given array
so we will take 3 lines as input
first line the size of the array
second line the element of the array
third line the number which frequency we have to find

So if we consider below sample as input

10
1 2 5 48 9 4 2 5 4 2
2

So frequency(Number of occurrence) of 2 is 3
so the output will be 3
